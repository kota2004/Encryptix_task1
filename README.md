# Encryptix_task1
This project is done as part of Internship with Encryptix and this was my first task

In this project I have implemented Naive-Bayes and SVM in Movie-Genre classification.

Notice: that In the .ipynb file which the code file for testing I have used test_data_solutons.txt file itself like the train_data.txt with outcome, I have just changed the name when using it in the code
I have used the datsets from kaggle I can't provide the datasets here because they are too big but here is the link for that --- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hijest/genre-classification-dataset-imdb
