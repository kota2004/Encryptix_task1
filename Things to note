This is project is done as part of Internship with Encryptix and this was my first task

In this project I have implemented Naive-Bayes and SVM in Movie-Genre classification.

Notice: that In the .ipynb file which the code file for testing I have used test_data_solutons.txt file itself like the train_data.txt with outcome, I have just changed the name when using it in the code
